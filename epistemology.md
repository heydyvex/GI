# epistemology or theory of knowledge  

theory of knowledge is the most fundamental field, thing that must be taken seriously  
We want AGI, so we need to know what is knowledge, how it can be created, and what is a problem and so on...  
Two thinkers that deeply understood this field are Karl Popper and David Deutsch.  
So we will rely on their understanding the nature of knowledge and problems.
